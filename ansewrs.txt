Exercise 1: Using fork() in C
-----------------------------
File: process_creation.c

Description:
- fork() creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.
- The child process gets pid == 0.
- The parent process gets the child’s PID.
- If fork fails, it returns a negative value.
- Demonstrates concurrent execution of parent and child processes.

---

Exercise 2: Starting Processes in the Background
------------------------------------------------
Commands:
- sleep 300 &   --> Starts a process in the background for 300 seconds.
- jobs          --> Lists all running background processes.

Explanation:
- The & operator allows the process to run in the background.
- jobs command is used to monitor background processes.

---

Exercise 3: Stopping Processes
------------------------------
Commands:
- ps aux | grep sleep  --> Find the PID of the sleep process.
- kill <PID>           --> Stop/terminate the process.
- ps aux | grep sleep  --> Verify the process is no longer running.

Explanation:
- ps lists all processes.
- kill sends a signal to terminate the process.

---

Exercise 4: Pausing and Resuming a Process
-----------------------------------------
Commands:
- kill -STOP <PID>  --> Pause the process.
- kill -CONT <PID>  --> Resume the process.

Explanation:
- STOP signal suspends the process temporarily.
- CONT signal resumes the suspended process.

Exercise 5: Role of the Linker
------------------------------
Files: file1.c & file2.c

Description:
- file1.c contains function hello() that prints a message.
- file2.c calls hello() in main().
- Compile and link: gcc file1.c file2.c -o output_program

Explanation:
- The linker combines multiple object files into a single executable.
- Resolves references between functions and variables across files.
- Modifying one file and recompiling only that file saves time during linking.

Job of the Linker:
- Combines object files (.o) into one executable.
- Resolves external references to functions and variables.

---

Exercise 6: Role of the Loader
------------------------------
File: simple_program.c

Description:
- Prints a simple message: "This is a simple program."
- Compile: gcc simple_program.c -o simple_program
- Check dynamic libraries: ldd simple_program

Explanation:
- The loader loads the program into memory when executed.
- It links the executable with dynamic libraries at runtime.

Job of the Loader:
- Loads the executable into memory.
- Prepares it for execution by linking with required libraries.

---

Makefile
---------
Description:
- Simplifies compilation of all examples.
- Provides targets for each program and a clean target to remove executables.

Example commands:
- make       --> Compile all programs.
- make clean --> Remove all compiled executables.

---

Running Programs
----------------
- ./process_creation  --> Run fork() example.
- ./output_program    --> Run linked files example.
- ./simple_program    --> Run loader example.
